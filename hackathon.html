			<h1>Why Hack for Food?</h1>
			  <p>Join other food enthusiasts, designers, coders, data-junkies, and citizens for the first ever Hack for Food to develop innovative solutions for local food systems, spurring local economic development and making food systems environmentally sustainable and socially just. Sponsored by Code for Asheville and the Asheville Buncombe Food Policy Council, the Hack for Food is part of the nationwide National Day of Civic Hacking. Whether you are a software coder or a citizen interested in local food systems, the Hack for Food is for you. Working together, we are going to build applications to support:</p>
			  <ol>
				  <li>An inventory of local food resources;</li>
				  <li>Identify and implement ways to increase local food production for local consumption;</li>
				  <li>Identify ways to increase access for those who currently do not have it;</li>
				  <li>Encourage locally grown food being served in City and County Schools;</li>
				  <li>Develop a plan and implement it through public-private partnerships to ensure a minimum of a one week’s supply of emergency food for the entire county’s population in any season of the year;</li>
				  <li>Identify economic development opportunities related to agriculture that will enable our region to become nutritionally self-sufficient and economically robust;</li>
				  <li>Track progress toward increased food production, access, and agriculture-related economic development and to report it out to the public and to policy makers regularly;</li>
			  </ol>

			<h1>White House Press Release<h1>
			<h3>Roll Up Your Sleeves, Get Involved, and Get Civic-Hacking</h3>
			<p>This summer,&nbsp;on June 1-2, 2013, citizens in cities across the Nation will join together to improve their communities and governments as part of the National Day of Civic Hacking.</p>
			<p>Civic Hacking Day is an opportunity for software developers, technologists, and entrepreneurs to unleash their can-do American spirit by collaboratively harnessing publicly-released data and code to create innovative solutions for problems that affect Americans. &nbsp;While civic hacking communities have long worked to improve our country and the world, this summer will mark the first time local developers from across the Nation unite around the shared mission of addressing and solving challenges relevant to OUR blocks, OUR neighborhoods, OUR cities, OUR states, and OUR country.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>National Day of Civic Hacking is a call to action for anyone who wants to make a positive impact on their town, city, and country. &nbsp;A coalition of leading organizations, companies, and government agencies have banded together to issue this challenge with the goal of promoting transparency, participation, and collaboration among governments, startups, and citizens. These partners will support Civic Hacking Day by hosting activities across the country that invite anyone to become part of the civic hacker community&mdash;whether you&rsquo;re a newbie or an expert&mdash;and by &nbsp;connecting people in person or online during the weekend celebration.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an opportunity for citizens in every town and city across the Nation to roll up their sleeves, get involved, and work together to improve our society by cultivating an ecosystem for innovation and change. &nbsp;Activities are already being planned in Augusta, GA; Alexandria, VA; Asheville, NC; Austin, TX; Bend, OR; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; Detroit, MI; Grand Rapids, MI; Honolulu, HI; Lexington, KY; Miami, FL*; Oakland, CA; Palo Alto, CA; Portland, ME; New York City, NY; Philadelphia, PA; Sacramento, CA*; San Diego, CA; San Francisco, CA; Seattle, WA; and Tucson, AZ.&nbsp;</p>
